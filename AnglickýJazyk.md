## 1. Family
A family usually consists of a mother, father and children, who live together in one home. A functioning family should provide protection, education, help and security to all its members. Strong relationships are often created between siblings, cousins, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and other relatives. 

All family members have some duties and responsibilities. Parents should teach their children what is good and bad, how to solve problems in life, how to become an independent person and care about others. Democratic parents talk with their children and respect them. Strict parents do not make compromises, which often creates a generation gap between them and their own children. The main duty of children is learning and going to school. They should also help their parents with housework. 

Modern European families are monogamous. Most of young people get married in their late twenties or early thirties. Many young people live together in the same home but are not a husband and wife. This is called cohabitation. Older generations think this is not correct. 

The wedding is a formal act and it takes place in a town hall or in a church. The engaged couple exchange their wedding rings and promise themselves to live together in good and bad and in illness too. Nowadays, many couples are divorced. Their frequent reasons for a divorce are problems with trust, money, living with parents and parents-in-law, alcohol, drugs, gambling and unemployment. 

When one of the parents dies, children stay with a single parent. A woman who loses her husband is called a widow and a man a widower. When they get married again, the new parents are called step-parents. Sometimes, divorced parents get married once again. Bad relationships with new step-parents lead to problems and frequent arguments. 

Family life is different all around the world. In Slovakia many families meet together for special days, such as birthdays, weddings, feasts and funerals. A family, a real home and relatives are what we need for life. They always help us when we need them. 


&nbsp;
## 2. Culture and Art
Culture and art are important for us because they add aesthetic value to our lives, use they add aesthetic value to our lives. Cultural events are an interesting way how people can spend their free time. Art is a way of communicating feelings. Artists express themselves in many forms music, literature, architecture, painting, drawing, sculpture. Music, dance and theatre are performing arts. Painting, sculpture, architecture and photography are decorative arts.

Cities offer many cultural attractions to citizens and tourists. People who like classical music can enjoy a chamber music concert in concert halls. Mozart, Beethoven and Bach have become the most important European composers. Fans of different music styles - pop, rock, jazz, blues or country can enjoy music at the festivals, go to see their favourite singers or bands perform live at concerts or simply
listen to CDs, MP3 players or watch concerts on DVDs. In towns, people have the possibility to go to the theatre to see various performances. The most popular are musicals. Film lovers can go to cinemas to watch dubbed or subtitled films. The multi-screen air-conditioned complexes in shopping centres are becoming more and more popular. Open- air cinemas are a popular option among the young in summer. The lovers of fine arts can go to galleries to see the artwork of famous painters and sculptors. The works of Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Michelangelo are immortal.

Cultural events in villages and rural areas are not very frequent. In Slovak villages, the so-called houses of culture are the main centres of cultural life. The most popular cultural events in villages are dance balls where people dance polka, waltz, tango or modern dances. Slovak villages are famous for promoting folklore traditions. There are folklore festivals of folklore music, dances and songs organised for example in Východná, Myjava, Detva and elsewhere. Nowadays, most young people prefer modern music and modern dance to folklore.

&nbsp;
## 3. Sports and Games
There are indoor and outdoor sports. Gymnastics is sport. It can all the year round in gyms. Athletics, cycling, hiking and most aquatic (water) sports, like sailing, regatta, water-skiing, diving, wind-surfing and others are outdoor sports practised mainly during the summer. Swimming is also a typical summer sport. In winter it is possible to practise it in indoor pools. Sportsmen practise winter sports, such as skiing, skating, snowboarding and tobogganing. Skiers can practise the giant slalom, downhill racing or ski jumps in ski resorts where there are good snow conditions. In Slovakia there are a lot of ski resorts in the High and Low Tatras. 

Games are played by at least two players. The most popular games are football, rugby, hockey, tennis, golf, cricket, basketball, volleyball, badminton, squash and handball. The British are sport-loving people. The Cup Final is the most important football match of the year in England. It is played at the Wembley Stadium near London. The Slovaks are good at hockey. A lot of Slovak hockey players play in American and Canadian National Hockey League teams. Becoming a professional hockey player is one of the most frequent dreams of Slovak boys. Tennis, another popular game, is played on courts. The most famous tennis tournament is held at Wimbledon every year. The championships are watched by thousands of people all over the world. The most popular games in America are baseball, American football, rugby, basketball, tennis, squash, boxing, wrestling and ice hockey. Squash is a game for two players played in a four-walled court with a special racket and a soft ball. 

Most people do sports because it is good for their body and mind. Some sport activities, such as aerobics, jogging, swimming or body building, are preferred by those who want to lose weight. Doing a sport is a good way of spending free time. Professional sports are often connected with overtraining or doping. During important competitions, such as the Olympic Games, sportsmen are tested and may easily be disqualified. This has a negative impact on their career. Success in professional sports is nowadays connected with money and popularity.

&nbsp;
## 4. Housing
Living in towns and cities has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there are many possibilities for jobs, education, sports and social life. There are many cultural events there, such as concerts, operas and theatre performances. People can visit cafés, pubs and night clubs. There are many shops, shopping malls and hospitals too. On the other hand, city inhabitants live in polluted, noisy, crowded and hectic places. There is often a lot of mess and dirt in the streets. Many city people live in housing estates, which is not an ideal place for children. There is also a high level of crime. 

Many Slovaks live in flats. Some of them have cottages in the mountains where they like spending their weekends. The British prefer to live in houses. There are several types of houses in Britain, for example terraced houses which are built in a row, semi-detached houses that have one common wall, detached houses that stand by themselves and bungalows. Some Slovak houses are big enough for two families - grandparents, their children and grandchildren. 

The furniture in British and Slovak rooms is not very different these days. The sitting room has a settee and armchairs, a wall unit and a hi-fi system, television and video, a bookcase and a coffee table. There is a carpet on the floor to make the room warm and comfortable. Most of the British houses have a fireplace because of cold weather. In the kitchen there are kitchen cupboards, a sink, a cooker, a fridge. There is also a table with chairs or stools. The floor in the kitchen is often tiled. Slovak families usually have their  washing machine in the bathroom, the British in the kitchen. The bedroom has a double bed, built-in wardrobes, a dressing table with a mirror and a stool in front of the table. 

In the USA an average American family lives in a large house with many rooms. In large American cities, many people live in downtown apartments (flats). Like the British, Americans do not usually stay in the same house their whole lives. Some families like to move to other parts of the country and change houses every ten years. 

&nbsp;
## 5. Shopping and Services 
Shopping is an activity people love or hate. Nowadays, people can do shopping in huge shopping centres or in small specialised shops. A shopping mall is a large indoor shopping centre with different types of shops, cinemas, wellness centres and bowling centres. They also have cafés, snack bars, restaurants where people can relax after doing shopping. They are open late in the evening and on weekends. Department stores sell their customers all kinds of foods, clothes, shoes, toys, sporting goods, cosmetics, books and furniture all under one roof. Many Slovaks do their shopping in hypermarkets, such as Carrefour or Tesco. 

There are still some small specialised shops which save your time, energy and money too. Corner shops sell different foodstuffs (tea, coffee, bottled beer, juice, sweets, vegetables, fruit) and dairy products (milk, butter, cream, cheese and yoghurt). They also sell newspapers and magazines. Various kinds of fresh bread, rolls, buns and cakes can be bought at the baker's. Butcher's sell fresh, canned or frozen meat and meat products (salami, ham, sausages). Fresh vegetables and all kinds of fruit can be bought at the greengrocer's. Many people prefer shopping at the market where there is a wide choice of potatoes, cabbage, beans, carrots, tomatoes, apples, pears, oranges or bananas. The chemist's is a specialised shop where people can buy medicines but also cosmetics. Boutiques sell different dresses, shirts, skirts, blouses, pullovers, jeans and so on. Shoes, belts and bags are sold in shoe shops. 

In everyday life, people also need different kinds of services performed by hairdressers, car-mechanics, garden designers, plumbers, lawyers, real estate agents or doctors. Almost everybody uses postal services. The post distributes letters, postcards, telegrams and parcels to the recipients. If the post cannot deliver a letter or parcel for some reason, it is sent back to the sender. We can also use postal services to send money. In the past, people sent many letters and postcards by post. Nowadays, they send e-mail letters, e-mail postcards or text messages. Banks provide financial services to the people. We can pay cash or by bank card. In Slovakia it is not usual to pay by cheque. Most people have a current account in a bank. Their earnings regularly come to their account. When they need cash, they withdraw money from the account through a cash machine, using a bank card. for If we need to borrow money, the bank can give us a loan. If the bank lends us money building a house, the money is called a mortgage. 

&nbsp;
## 6. Health Care
More and more people know that good health means a longer and happier life. Nowadays, people care about their health more than they did in the past. They eat healthier food, practise different kinds of sports and try to avoid stressful situations. A healthy, strong and beautiful body is an ideal for many people. Being in a good shape and good mental health are the basic conditions for good life. Doctors often say that headaches and stomachaches are the results of depression. Bad eating habits, lack of physical activities and stress are negative factors which cause serious diseases. 

When we are ill, we usually see a doctor (general practitioner). Sometimes, we we need to have an appointment with a specialist. The doctor examines our body, asks about the symptoms and usually prescribes some medication on a prescription. Then, we go to the pharmacy to get our antibiotics, painkillers or vitamins. When the illness is too serious, the patient is taken to the hospital to be operated. Basic health care is free in Slovakia for all people who pay their insurance monthly. 

Everybody goes through various diseases during their childhood and adult life. Most of the diseases are not serious and do not take a long time to cure. In the past, diseases, such as flu, tuberculosis or scarlet fever, killed many people. Nowadays, there exist vaccines against most of them. There are diseases which we have problems to cure or cannot cure at all yet. Cancer is one of them. More than 3.6 million people are infected with AIDS. Many countries in the world spend a lot of money on public campaigns and advertisements which warn of the dangers. Publicity advices heterosexuals to use a condom and have one sexual partner only. 

&nbsp;
## 7. Traveling
People travel to work, to school, on business or for pleasure. When people travel abroad for holidays, they often address travel agencies to arrange travel, accommodation, insurance and a travel guide. Slovaks do not need passports anymore to travel to the EU countries. They only need their identification cards. Last minute or first moment offers are very popular. 

Airports, railway stations, seaports and bus stops are always full of people travelling for long or short distances. Travelling by air is exciting, fast, comfortable, relatively safe but expensive. Passengers need their flight tickets and passports. People and their luggage is checked when they go through the customs. During the flight, passengers are offered some meals, refreshments and drinks by stewards and stewardesses. 

People commute by trains to work or school. They are cheap, less polluting and safe but not very clean and comfortable. Slow trains stop at every station. Fast trains and intercity trains are more comfortable for longer distances. They do not stop at every station. Trains on longer journeys often have a sleeping car and a dining car. 

Coaches are buses for long-distance travel. They are fast and comfortable and not very expensive. In our country many people prefer coaches to trains. During the holidays, travel coach trips to mountain or seaside resorts. When travelling by coach to London, passengers can have an interesting experience of crossing the English many agencies offer Channel by ferry. 

Cars are comfortable and quick; they are not safe, they pollute the environment and are expensive. It is interesting that the number of cars, drivers and highways is higher every year. In Slovakia the age limit for a driving licence is eighteen. Careful driving, respecting speed limits and strict alcohol tests reduce traffic accidents. 

Many people like travelling by bike. Some go to school by bike; others prefer cycling as a sport ora hobby. Many people go on a cycling holiday. Cycling is healthy and exciting. 

&nbsp; 
## 8. Education 
Good education is very important for a successful life. In Slovakia school attendance is compulsory from the age of 6 to 16. After nursery schools and kindergartens, children start to attend an elementary school at the age of 6. When they are 16, they can decide to leave the school with an elementary qualification or to continue to a secondary school. Pupils usually have to pass entrance exams to continue their studies at secondary schools. The best students apply to study at a grammar school (or high school) called gymnázium, which prepares for university study. There are ary different types of secondary schools which usually take 4 years; the most popular are secondary business schools, technical schools and medical schools. Vocational schools and their training centres prepare students for different kinds of professions. The study lasts either 3 years and it ends with achieving a skill certificate or 5 years which ends with a school-leaving exam called maturita. Some subjects are compulsory, others are elective. Students at vocational schools must take a theoretical and practical exam from their specialised subjects too. After finishing study at secondary schools, students can get a job or apply to study at university. In most cases, they have to take an entrance exam to get in. A study at university takes 5 or 6 years and finishes with graduation where graduates are given diplomas to their majors. 

Students schedule and school subjects differ from school to school. Vocational school students must also take some practical lessons outside their schools, called the practice. A school year in Slovakia starts the first week of September and finishes the last week of June. In between, there are a few days off (for example the All Saint's Day, Easter or the May days). There are winter holidays, which last about two weeks and spring holidays, which last one week. The summer holidays are the longest and last two months. 

Extracurricular activities are very popular in the afternoons. There are many different clubs and sports teams at schools which meet after the classes. Many schools publish their own student newspapers and some have their own radio stations. Most schools in Slovakia have their own gym, school canteen and sometimes a swimming pool, school playground and language schools. 

&nbsp;
## 9. Jobs
Employment is contract between an employer and an employee. The employer is a person (or an institution) who hires employees. People who have their own business are self-employed. The unemployed are people who lost their job, quit or were fired. They live on the dole and are on a list in job centres, which help them find a new job. 

When people search for a new job, they look at several factors, such as type of work, possible promotion and career development, salary, working time, travel opportunities, place of work and others. The available positions are published in the newspapers or on the Internet. The candidates send the job application and their CV (curriculum vitae) together with a letter of motivation. Their CV should include personal data and details about education, skills and work experience. The best candidates are invited to an oral interview. At the interview, they usually answer questions, describe their motivations and expectations. Candidates should prepare well for the interview, find information about the organisation or the company, answer clearly and stay calm. Successful candidates are offered a job with a starting salary, position, medical benefits and vacation days. 

People have full-time jobs and part-time jobs. Doctors, nurses, truck drivers work in shifts. Manual workers work in manufacturing or construct buildings. Teachers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, artists work intellectually. Nowadays, more and more professions require communication and organisation skills. Professions like a policeman, pilot, construction worker are very dangerous professions because there is a high risk of an injury or an accident. 

The labour market in Slovakia changed in the last ten years. Many work opportunities were created thanks to foreign investors who came to our country to set up their companies here. Young people with good reference and experience are preferred to fresh graduates and older people. 

&nbsp;
## 10. People and Nature
Slovakia has a continental climate with four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. The weather in spring and autumn is alike: light showers, cloudy days and sunny intervals are typical. Winters are normally cold and snowy. Summers are hot, with many sunny days and a few summer storms. 

The climate of a region determines what plants grow and what animals live in that region. Plants are an important part in the cycle of nature. There would be no life on Earth without them. Animals depend directly or indirectly on plants because they cannot make their own food. Plants also produce the oxygen we breathe. According to the scientists, there are about 260 000 species of plants and about 9 or 10 million species of animals. Nowadays, the existence of some plants and animals is in danger. For example elephants, tigers, pandas, whales, great apes, marine turtles, polar bears, rhinos, snow leopards and dolphins are at the top of the Red List of Threatened Species. In Slovakia bisons, wolves, foxes, eagles are also in danger. 

The most serious ecological problems of today are the pollution of air, water and soil, destruction of ecosystems, disappearance of many species of animal and plants, changes in weather, acid rain, global warming, destruction of tropical rain forests and destruction of the ozone layer. Most of this damage, which proceeds faster and faster, has not been caused by natural catastrophes but by man himself. Technical progress, which enables us to live a more comfortable life, leads to the degradation of quality of environment we live in. 

Professional organisations, environmentalists, ecologists, biologists, volunteers or just nature lovers do their best to protect nature and save life on Earth. We all can contribute to this by respecting the laws of nature. In forests, it is not allowed to make noise, set fire, cut wood, drop litter, poison air and lakes with chemicals and so on. People can be fined or even imprisoned for breaking the laws. 

&nbsp;
## 11. Science and Technology
Technology is a product of science. Society depends on technology and technology exists thanks to the needs of society. New technological inventions make people's life easier. The industrial revolution, which started in the 18th century in England, brought many technological changes and inventions. Since then, technology has become part of our everyday life. 

People made big scientific and technological progress in transport, medicine, biology and information technology. The progress in the car industry and aviation is also incredible. We can see it when we compare how people travelled in the past and how they travel today. 

Great progress has been made in medicine. Science and technology helps ease the pain of some diseases, it cures them and prevents some of them too. Nowadays, doctors can help in surgeries that are taking place in another part of the country. On the video phone, a doctor can see the patient and speak directly to the doctors performing the operation. 

During the last ten years, there was a great change in information and communication technologies, especially in wireless technology. Nowadays, computers are used almost everywhere. The inventions of a cell phone and the Internet help people communicate faster. Mobile phones are a symbol of comfortable and quick communication or fashion, mainly among the young. A cell phone, music player, camera and a palm computer are being put together into one little gadget. 

The Internet saves our time and money to find information. Many professions or services depend on the Internet. Via the Internet, we send documents, buy things, book hotels, reserve tickets, transfer our money or find life partners. These days, more and more people use e-mail to communicate and send information or documents. Many Slovaks use the Internet as a type of entertainment. They can easily find articles about what they are interested in, download music or films. Chatting, joining different discussion groups and reading blogs is very popular, especially among the young. 

Modern technology helps us daily. However, it can also be misused. For example, on the one hand, we drive cars daily and on the other hand, they pollute the air. 

&nbsp;
## 12. People and Society
Etiquette describes formal rules and traditions of behaviour in a certain society and culture. Modern etiquette teaches us to greet people with respect, offer hospitality to guests, wear clothing appropriate for certain occasions, join the conversations without dominating them. It also describes how to behave in specific situations. It teaches us to offer a chair, help those who need it, eat neatly and quietly, not to play loud music or make noise and arrive in time when visiting somebody. 

Different social rules are followed at home, at work and in business. The social rules of hosting guests, dining, clothing, etc. are specific for different cultures. What is appropriate in one culture (for example in a European country) can be totally unacceptable in another culture (for example in a Muslim country). Some rules are the same all around the world. It is important to be polite and to use the magic words: "Thank you", "Please", "Sorry". When somebody invites us for a visit, we should come in time. We should bring a small present to the host, for example flowers, chocolate or a bottle of wine. It is not polite to visit somebody without arranging it in advance. The food etiquette includes some rules. For example, it is impolite to ask for more food. It is fine to have more food when it is offered by the hosts. The tea should be poured from a teapot after a minute or two it has been made. Soup should be eaten quietly. Hands should never be used for eating. 

Children learn the social rules from their parents, teachers and friends. It is important to teach them what behaviour is correct and wrong. Family is the place where social behaviour is formed. If parents speak rudely, children will imitate their "models". If parents have only TV dinners, children will not know how to behave at the table. Small things such as talking to people with respect, listening to them and showing empathy should be normal in every family. 

&nbsp;
## 13. The Young and Their World
People from the age of thirteen to the age of nine because their age in "teen" in English. During puberty, most children go through dramatic physical changes. Teenagers also undergo mental developments. Their emotional life is more intensive than before. Love and friendship become the most important values. Teenagers prefer relationships with their peers to their parents. 

Young people often feel unstable and look for security. They search for a unique identity. Sports play. ers, rock stars, film actors, reality show stars often become their role models. Teenagers care a lot about what they look like. They follow the fashion trends closely and they always want to be "in". They have similar interests such as music, dance, film or fashion. They identify themselves with others, but at the same time they want to be different and develop their own individuality. 

This age of revolt often leads to conflicts between the generations, called a generation gap. Young people think that their parents care too much and are overprotective. Children often have different ideas about their future, different life expectations and opinions on drug use or politics than their parents do. All this creates tension between parents and children. They also differ in clothing and hairstyles. Most teenagers would like to start their own independent lives but are still financially dependent on their parents. In this age, young people are under pressure. They have to decide about their future career. 

Unemployment is a big problem in our society. Financial worries, frustration, unstable emotions and lack of emotional intelligence among some adolescents may also lead to youth crime, such as vandalism and violence. Groups of youngsters with racial prejudice often provoke conflicts in many countries. Alcoholism, drug use and gambling are the results of frustration, family conflicts or other teenage problems. 

&nbsp;
## 14. Food
Normally, we eat three times a day - we have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Eating habits on the lifestyle of people. Busy managers do not eat regularly, young people often choose fast food, women who want to lose weight eat as little as possible and kids are often fussy about their food. 

Slovaks usually have bread with butter, jam, honey, ham or cheese for breakfast; some prefer scrambled eggs or sausage. The English usually begin the day with a cup of tea or coffee. The traditional English breakfast starts with cereals - porridge or cornflakes. This is sometimes followed by fried bacon and eggs or sausages with fried tomatoes, often on the weekends. 

In our country lunch is the main meal consisting of soup, a main course with a side dish and a dessert. Slovaks like to eat meat, usually pork, beef or poultry with potatoes or rice. Bryndzové halušky (gnocchi with sheep cheese) is considered a Slovak national meal. Hungarian cuisine, typical for spicy meals, is quite popular in the southern parts of Slovakia. Italian cuisine, mostly pizza and pasta, has become very popular in our country and it is preferred to traditional Slovak meals in many restaurants. Some Slovaks like going to Chinese or Mexican restaurants. Schoolchildren have lunch in canteens. Businessmen eat in restaurants where a daily menu at reduced prices is offered during lunchtime. In Britain lunch is a light meal consisting of a warm dish (rarely soup) and a dessert, or just sandwiches, some fruit, pudding or ice cream. Beef, chicken or lamb is served with potatoes, vegetables and gravy. Many Americans like to have lunch and dinner "out" - at snack bars, fast food restaurants or expensive hotels. They also use take-away services. 

Dinner, the main meal in Britain and America, is served in the evening at between 6 and 7 o'clock when all the members of the family are at home. This meal is often eaten in front of the television. Most dinners during the week are simple, often using pre-cooked food with frozen vegetables, which can be heated quickly. Many supermarkets sell frozen "TV dinners", which can be quickly prepared in the oven or a microwave. Typical take-away food includes pizza, Chinese food and the traditional fish and chips. The Slovaks prepare dinner themselves at home. It is either a warm meal or a sandwich. Sometimes they order pizza. Some people have a light supper, often cheese and biscuits and a glass of milk or a mug of cocoa before going to bed. 

&nbsp;
## 15. Hobbies, Leisure and Lifestyle
Free time after work or study is for fun, entertainment, going out or doing hobbies. Hobbies are connected to lifestyles. Some people like to be on their own and learn new things by reading books. Others enjoy company and often go out or do collective sports. Our hobbies should fit our character and complement well our work or study. 

Teenagers have their own special leisure interests. These include playing team sports, dancing at a favourite disco, going to parties or joining some clubs. They like to spend their leisure time actively in groups, in good company. Those who prefer staying at home usually watch DVDs, listen to music, browse the Internet or chat on the Internet. Typical teenage sports are roller-skating and skateboarding. 

Many children and young people join different clubs where they practise their hobbies. The most popular are football, tennis, dance or horse riding clubs. Sometimes, it is not their choice but the choice of their parents. Some parents force their children to play an instrument or do some sport because they think they will prevent them from taking drugs or drinking alcohol. 

Many people have creative hobbies, such as acting, choir singing, folk dancing and playing pop-music in amateur groups. Photography, painting and drawing are also popular hobbies. There are many opportunities for people to develop their talents in these areas. 

A lot of people, both children and adults, keep a pet. Older people like gardening, doing practical jobs around their houses (DIY - do it yourself), fishing, reading, going to theatre, concerts or art exhibitions. Slovak pensioners are quite traditional and prefer staying at home. 

At present, more and more people of all ages spend their leisure time doing exercises to keep fit. Hiking, cycling, rowing, playing golf and tennis are enjoyed by people all over the world. It is quite common to see parties of hikers, cyclists or rowers spending their weekends outdoors. Those who prefer indoor physical exercises, such as body building or aerobics, go to fitness centres. A relatively recent sport enjoyed by the young is snow-boarding, which combines skiing, surfing and skateboarding. Many Slovaks travel abroad to practise less common sports, such as scuba diving, yachting and playing golf. 

&nbsp;
## 16. Multicultural Society
A multicultural society is a country where different cultural groups live together. They try to preserve their cultures, habits and traditions. Cultural differences should be respected and tolerated. This is the official policy in Canada, Australia and the UK. Immigrants can have dual citizenship, they can use their minority language and they can keep their culture and religion. In some countries they are expected to mix and integrate into the national culture. A typical example is the USA where immigrants preserve their own culture but also become Americans. Cultural adaptation is more difficult when immigrants have to adapt to different cultural values or religion. Lack of cultural integration can cause the isolation of immigrant minorities. This can provoke reactions of xenophobia and racism, which can lead to serious incidents. 

In 2004, Slovakia became part of a larger community - the European Community. Many Slovaks decided to leave the country for study or work; a lot of them got married abroad and created bicultural families. Living in a bicultural (or cross-cultural) family requires a lot of tolerance and understanding from both sides. Practising the traditions and habits of two cultures can be a good compromise and benefit for the couple and their children. Nowadays, there are many study programmes which make student exchange possible. Students go to live and study in a culturally different country in a "host family". Such exchanges are usually very beneficial. People learn about new cultures, make friends and become tolerant. 

Slovakia is also a multicultural country. The majority of Slovak population is Slovak. The country also has several minorities, the biggest of which are Hungarian, Roma, Ruthenian and Ukrainian. The Roma population in Slovakia has problems to adapt and is often a victim of racist attacks. 

### Public holidays
Public holidays in Great Britain are called "bank holidays". All the banks, offices, schools, shops and factories are closed. Bank holidays include Easter and Christmas, Easter is a typical spring holiday. In Britain it is celebrated over several days. On Good Friday, people eat hot cross buns and on Sunday people give each other chocolate There is nothing like Slovak traditions with water and willow whips. In the USA children like this holiday very much because the Easter Bunny comes with coloured chocolate eggs and candies. At Christmas houses, shops and streets are decorated with coloured lights, Christmas trees, holly, ivy or mistletoe. Christmas carols are sung in houses, cathedrals and churches. In Slovakia carol singers mostly sing in the villages. People buy presents and send Christmas cards to their relatives and friends. In Slovakia people open their presents, which they find under the Christmas tree on December, 24th. In Britain children hang their stockings at the foot of the bed for Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) to fill them. In the morning on Christmas Day, December, 25th, children get up early to open their Christmas presents. Families have a traditional Christmas dinner: in Britain it is stuffed turkey and Christmas pudding afterwards. In Slovakia it is fish (usually carp) with potato salad. The following day is the Boxing Day (December, 26th) when many people visit other members of their families. In Slovakia people also visit their families on this day. 
In the USA the Independence Day (July, 4th) is one of the most important public holidays. It celebrates the independence of American colonies from Britain. The oldest American holiday is the Thanksgiving Day. It reminds us of the first successful harvest which helped the colony at Plymouth to survive the winter. Halloween is a typical American holiday celebrated on October, 31th. According to an old tradition, it is a witches' holiday. It is popular with both young and old people, who dress themselves in fancy costumes and go to parties to have fun. The most famous holiday of the Irish people is the St. Patrick's Day (March 17th), named after the patron saint of Ireland, who brought Christianity to Ireland. On this day, people dress in green, eat Irish food and drink Guinness. St. Patrick's parades are seen in many towns and cities in Ireland and the USA.

## 17. Towns and Places
people live in different places during their life. They move from place to place for a new living, job, studies or marriage. Some people live in one place all their life. Our birthplace is the place where we were born and where our family and friends live. Many young people move when they decide to study in a different town or country. From time to time, all people leave their homes when they travel away for holidays. Some people look for quiet, peaceful places in the countryside which are far away from fast and hectic life in cities. The others search for places full of adventure and excitement. agency. 

Slovaks spend their holidays either in Slovakia or abroad. When they choose to go abroad for holidays, they usually contact a travel agency. They choose a holiday resort from a catalogue and the travel agent gives them all the necessary information about the stay. During their holidays, they communicate with a guide who represents the travel agency.

## 18. Fashion
Fashion is the way people dress in a certain period of time. It changes very fast. Sometimes, it is quite difficult to say what is still trendy or what is already out of fashion. The clothes people wear tell us about their age, origin, religion, interests and financial situation. Fashion is a way of self-expression, especially for the young. They show their mood, interests, attitudes and status in society through styles, colours, patterns, materials and accessories. Most young people get dressed according to their own taste. They wear casual clothes, such as jeans, baggy trousers, loose sweatshirts and sneakers. Some young people buy brand name clothes in expensive shops and boutiques to be "in". 

Clothing is connected with weather. In summer, light and airy materials, such as cotton or silk, are preferred. We wear short-sleeved or sleeveless shirts, T-shirts, loose blouses, skirts, shorts, sandals and slippers. For swimming, we wear a swimming costume. In winter, warmer materials like cotton, wool and nylon are preferred. Long-sleeved T-shirts, shirts, sweaters, jumpers, pullovers, cardigans, polo necks, jackets, anoraks, coats, gloves, hats, caps, scarves and boots are worn. 

People dress differently for various occasions. Balls and banquets require formal smart clothes. Especially women take special care of being dressed-up and looking good at such occasions. They spend a lot of money on ball dresses, shoes, accessories, decorative items and jewellery (necklace, bracelet, earrings, rings). Ladies' handbags should match their dresses and shoes. Gentlemen wear a dark suit or tuxedo, a white shirt with cuff links, a single colour bow tie and dark shoes. 

Not only special occasions require special clothes. In some jobs people wear uniforms, denims, white coats, costumes, aprons. In some private British schools, children have to wear uniforms to hide social and financial differences. 

Another important part of our image is hair. Nowadays, there is great freedom in hairstyles and colours. Boys grow their hair long, have highlights done, while girls have their hair very short, spiky and often dyed, highlighted or bleached. 

&nbsp;
## 19. English-Speaking Countries
English is a mother tongue for most people living in the Unites States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. These countries share the same language, but every one of them has its own traditions and habits. 

Great Britain comprises England, Wales and Scotland. Together with Northern Ireland, it forms the United Kingdom. It includes four nations: the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish. They differ in their way of life, customs, values and traditions. In England people are said to be reserved in manners, dress and speech. They are conservative and stick to traditions. They are famous for their politeness, self-discipline, reliability and for their specific sense of humour. It is true that the British rarely shake hands when they meet. They like sport, especially football, cricket, golf, tennis and horse racing. 

Scotland is a country where special traditions are kept, such as playing bagpipes and wearing kilts (typical knee-length skirts for both men and women). There are many whisky distilleries with a long tradition. The Scottish people speak various dialects of English and Gaelic. 

Wales is rich in culture and history. The Welsh people are known for their love of music and poetry. There are two languages spoken in Wales - English and Welsh, which is a Celtic language and very different from English. 

Northern Ireland lies on the north of the island of Ireland and is a part of the United Kingdom. Most of the country is rural and over half of the population is Protestant. The Republic of Ireland is a sovereign state and is mostly Catholic. Conflicts between Protestants and Catholics are still alive. The Catholic community wants Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland, whereas the Protestant community wants to remain part of the UK. The Irish people are hospitable and friendly, they like music and dancing. Social life concentrates in pubs where live music and drinking is very common. important 

The United States of America is home to people mostly of European origin but also of Afro-American, Native American, Japanese, Chinese and other origins. The people in the USA also speak their minority and immigrant languages. Spanish is an language, especially in the southern states. 

It is said that Americans are loud, extremely self-conscious, dressed in tasteless clothes. However, when you get to know them better, you find out that they are open, friendly, hard-working and independent. America is a wealthy country and Americans enjoy high standard of living. However, there are also many poor people there. 

It is a typical custom to teach children independence from an early age. Each adult member of a typical American family has his/her own car. Most Americans drive to work and students often drive to school. Americans like travelling and they often drive long distances through the country, especially during the holidays, to visit their friends and relatives. 

Americans do not usually stay in the same town all their lives. They like to move. It is not unusual for families to move house or go to live in another town or state more than once every ten years. 

Nowadays, more and more Americans take care of their health. They do some sport, eat healthier food, smoke less and drink less alcohol. Smoking is banned in some public places.

&nbsp;
## 20. Slovakia - My Homeland
The Slovak Republic is an independent state situated in Central Europe. Tourists come here to see spectacular sceneries, old towns and cities, fairy tale castles, caves and spa resorts. 

Foreign visitors can learn the history of the Great Moravian Empire or the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy. They are also interested in the events of the Velvet Revolution in November 1989. Nowadays, they visit an independent country, which is a member of the European Union. 

There are many interesting places to visit in Slovakia. There are several national parks and protected natural resorts, such as the High Tatras, the Low Tatras, the Slovak Paradise and others. The High Tatras is situated in the north of Slovakia and it creates a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. Its highest peaks are Gerlachovský Štít (2 655 m), Lomnický štít (2 632 m) and Kriváň (2 494 m). The High Tatras is also famous for its valleys and lakes (Štrbské pleso). The High Tatras National Park is Slovakia's largest. With its natural beauties, the area attracts many tourists all the year round. The Slovak Paradise is a romantic and picturesque region located in the north-east. There are beautiful caves, waterfalls but also vast plains with fascinating views of the area. Dobšinská ľadová jaskyňa, located in the west part of this valley, is the oldest ice cave in Europe. 

Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is a political, cultural and industrial centre of the country. The larger towns of Slovakia include Košice, Prešov, Nitra, Žilina and Banská  Bystrica. The smaller towns are visited by tourists because of their rich cultural history and beautiful architecture. Banská Štiavnica is known for its mining history. The largest wooden altar in the world, made by Master Paul in the early 16th century, made Levoča famous. Other small Slovak towns, for example Bojnice, Zvolen, Trenčín and many others, are famous for their beautiful castles. The Spiš Castle, the largest medieval castle in Central Europe and Vlkolínec, a mountain village, are included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List.

They have a positive attitude to their country. 

&nbsp;
## 21. Human Relationships
Human relationship describes the way people get on with each other and behave towards each other. Informal relationships are created between parents, children, married couples or friends. Formal relationships are formed among people at school, work or in the streets. These relationships are not very deep and open. They are formed among people of different social positions: teachers and students, employers and employees, doctors and patients, etc. Such relationships require respect and politeness. 

Nowadays, human relationships are very complicated. Many people are stressed out, busy and tired. A good relationship is something that cannot be bought for money. It is about feelings, empathy, understanding, trust, care, politeness and satisfaction. 

Friendship is a relationship between people who have something in common and spend a lot of time together. They support and help each other when necessary. Friends are people who laugh together, speak about everything, share secrets. They show their true feelings. They accept each other as they are. Friends share memories, tears and smiles. True friends are people who are always there for you. Friendship is about giving and receiving equally. The saying "Friend in need is a friend indeed" shows the full value of friendship. There is no place for jealousy, ignorance and excuses. 

There are short-term and long-term relationships. Some friendships last for a short period of time, others for our whole life. We make friends during all stages of life. If we want to keep our friends for a long time, we should stay in touch with them, send e-mails, call them and spend some time together. Some friendships lose importance and die out. It happens when friends stop contacting each other. Sometimes, there is a conflict between them. When there is a conflict, it should be resolved by discussion. 

Families are the basic social units in which informal relationships are formed. Children learn the social rules from their parents, teachers and friends. It is important to teach them which behaviour is correct and which is wrong. Family is the place where social behaviour is formed. If parents speak rudely, children will imitate their "models". If parents have only TV dinners, children will not know how to behave at the table. Small things, such as talking to people with respect, listening to them and showing empathy, should be normal in every family. 

&nbsp;
## 22. Communication and Languages
Communication means exchanging thoughts, ideas, messages or information through speaking, writing, signals, sounds and behaviour. 

Direct communication happens in real time when participants communicate face to face. Besides words they use body language, which is different in every culture. Our facial expressions, eye contact, gestures and body posture talk for us too. Indirect communication means that senders and receivers of information do not see each other (and sometimes do not know each other). These participants communicate through various communication channels - telephones, letters, songs, posters, pictures, etc. 

The means of mass communication, such as radio, television and computers, enable communication among people in a very short time. The number of people using mobile phones has rapidly increased in the last years, especially in Eastern Europe. Skype or ICQ are modern and efficient ways of communication. They enable people to talk in real time and send and receive documents or pictures very quickly. 

Nowadays, almost all professions require excellent communication skills and knowledge of foreign languages. Using foreign languages helps us communicate with people abroad, make new friends or meet business partners. We learn about other countries and their cultures. We are happy when we read texts in a foreign language, understand songs and watch films without subtitles. These are the personal goals of many language learners. 

After the integration of Slovakia into the European Union in 2004, the possibilities for learning foreign languages increased. Some children learn English or another foreign language from a very early age. There are children, who are raised in bilingual families. This means that they have two mother tongues. English, German, Spanish, French and other foreign languages are taught at secondary schools. Russian has almost disappeared from our schools. 

Students at secondary schools take a final exam in one foreign language. The final language exam tests language skills, such as listening comprehension, reading comprehension, writing and speaking. Many students take extra classes at various language schools. Language learners can receive different language certificates on different levels. The most popular English ones are TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), the Cambridge certificates or City & Guilds. 

&nbsp;
## 23. Mass Media
We are in daily contact with different types of mass media. We receive information through television, newspaper, radio or the Internet. They are called mass media because they reach a very large audience. Mass media inform, educate and entertain They allow us to follow world affairs. Most people follow the national and international news regularly because they want to be well-informed. Many people watch them on TV or read them in newspapers, some read them on the Internet. 

### Television, Radio
There are people who like to watch documentary programmes because they take them to places they would never have a chance to see. People like to relax watching films, sitcoms, soap operas or series. Some people prefer reality shows. Watching TV for several hours a day damages the eyesight. It also prevents people from doing sports or being outside. Violence in films influences people in a bad way. Advertising helps finance TV channels. It has a great impact on people. 

Slovak television is a public television network. STV1 broadcasts news, political discussions, films, series and children programmes. STV2 specialises in documentaries, quiz shows, educational programmes and music. STV3 is a sports channel. Foreign language films on Slovak TV channels are dubbed, sometimes subtitled. Commercial stations, such as TV Markíza or TV Joj, also enjoy wide popularity. Thanks to TA3, the first Slovak news channel, Slovaks can watch current news throughout the whole day. 

Radio and television broadcasting in Britain is provided by BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) which has a very good international reputation. In the USA hundreds of radio stations broadcast in foreign languages for minorities. About 160 radio stations throughout the USA broadcast only in Spanish. 

### Newspapers
Most newspapers are daily newspapers. The most popular Slovak daily newspapers include SME, which is a broadsheet, and Pravda. Both of them are widely read and influential. The tabloid Nový Čas and its supplements Nový čas víkend and Nový čas p is very popular. Economic periodicals include the daily Hospodárske noviny and the weekly Trend. The Slovak Spectator is a weekly English language newspaper which informs its readers about Slovakia in English. Most of the newspapers now have their online editions. There are also many weekly and monthly lifestyle magazines for men, women, teenagers, for people interested in sports, gardening, cars, etc. There are five quality daily papers in Britain - The Times, The Guardian, The Financial Times, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph. They contain national and international news, business news, sport news and reports. The most popular tabloids are The Daily Mirror and The Sun. The largest daily newspapers published in the USA are The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The New York Post. 

### The Internet
The Internet presents a true revolution in many areas of our life. It has changed the way we study, work or spend free time. Via the e-mail, Skype or ICQ we can easily communicate with family, friends, business partners or the people we do not know. It is easy to find information of different types on the Internet. It is much quicker now to find out the information about departures of trains, opening hours or details about products or services. Search engines, online dictionaries and encyclopedias help us find relevant information. Many people use the Internet as a form of entertainment. Access to the Internet has also become easier in our country. Most schools, companies and institutions have access to it. It is becoming normal to use the Internet at home too. There is a lot of discussion about the safety of the Internet. They mostly concern the viruses or safety of personal information. 

&nbsp;
## 24. The Book - The Friend of People
Our first books are read to us by our parents or grandparents. These are fairy tales or stories and they normally have more pictures than text. The children's books by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm are popular worldwide. English classic children's books like Alice in Wonderland (written by Lewis Carroll) and Winnie the Pooh (written by A. A. Milne) have been read and loved by many generations of English children. 

Nowadays, people in Slovakia can read both original Slovak books and books translated from different languages, mainly English. They read fiction and non-fiction genres. Boys usually read adventure stories or science fiction, girls prefer romances or novels. Many young Slovaks have started to read in English. Adults like to read detective stories, historical novels or books of travels. Some also read non-fiction genres, such as biographies or scientific papers. Some people read poetry, but this genre is not easy to read. Fantasy series for children have become very popular genres in recent years. People also enjoy watching film versions of famous books which they have read. Books make us think, amuse us and give answers to some questions. A good book is also a pleasant way to escape from the real world. 

Books can be bought in a wide range of bookshops. Some are small and quite specialised; others are situated in big shopping centres. It is becoming more and more popular to buy a book via the Internet. It is also possible to read a book in electronic form; such a book is called an e-book. 

People read less than they did in the past. They do not look for information in book: (such as encyclopedias or textbooks) as much as they used to. They need to save as much time as possible. Therefore, they prefer to look up the information on the Internet Instead of reading good fiction, they watch films. Reading a book takes days or week watching a film just one or two hours. People do not need to concentrate so much; they c not need to imagine things. Everything is ready for them on the screen. Adults read mo and more magazines because it takes less time and concentration than reading a book. Some people think that books will die out one day. They say that everything will be read in electronic form and people will have less and less time books. Others argue that reading is a hobby for many people and books the cultural heritage of every nation. That is why they think that books will always be here and are irreplaceable.

&nbsp;
## 25. Idols and Celebrities
An ideal person does not exist because every individual has positive and negative traits. We often speak about heroes. Every country has important personalities in their history who become idols for many generations. They often include politicians or artists. War heroes died for the ideas they believed in: defending their country, fighting for peace. They saved many people's lives. Heroes are also people who have difficult or challenging jobs, such as volunteers in regions of war or natural catastrophes, rescuers, fire-fighters, soldiers or doctors. We admire their qualities, such as courage, talent, energy, charm, sense of humour, etc. 

During adolescence, young people often search for unique identity. At this age, sports players, rock stars, film and television performers (e.g. reality show stars) become role models for them. Many stars became idols through publicity in the mass media Idols are usually well-known in society. They are usually young and always look good and stylish. They have their own fashion designers and stylists. However, their popularity does not last a very long time. Mass media often inform people about idols' lives and create various scandals. Role models are often criticised. Pop Idol is the most famous talent contest to find the best young singer or pop idol in the country. Viewers vote for their idols by mobile phone text messages. These types of idols have a great influence on people of a certain age. Young people copy their image and behaviour because they want to resemble them. Reality show stars are "pseudo-idols", which means they are not real idols. They are admired for no real reasons. 

Fictional heroes - heroes from books, films or plays often become idols admired by generations of readers. Some film heroes are handsome, strong and brave; others are violent or possess superhuman characteristics. 

Most of us admire people who are not at all famous but are ordinary. Still, they are idols for us because they represent certain human traits which we admire. Our parents, grandparents, siblings or friends are often idols for us for their love, help, friendship, support and courage to fight against difficulties in life.
