## 1. Family
A family usually consists of a mother, father and children, who live together in one home. A functioning family should provide protection, education, help and security to all its members. Strong relationships are often created between siblings, cousins, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and other relatives. 

All family members have some duties and responsibilities. Parents should teach their children what is good and bad, how to solve problems in life, how to become an independent person and care about others. Democratic parents talk with their children and respect them. Strict parents do not make compromises, which often creates a generation gap between them and their own children. The main duty of children is learning and going to school. They should also help their parents with housework. 

Modern European families are monogamous. Most of young people get married in their late twenties or early thirties. Many young people live together in the same home but are not a husband and wife. This is called cohabitation. Older generations think this is not correct. 

The wedding is a formal act and it takes place in a town hall or in a church. The engaged couple exchange their wedding rings and promise themselves to live together in good and bad and in illness too. Nowadays, many couples are divorced. Their frequent reasons for a divorce are problems with trust, money, living with parents and parents-in-law, alcohol, drugs, gambling and unemployment. 

When one of the parents dies, children stay with a single parent. A woman who loses her husband is called a widow and a man a widower. When they get married again, the new parents are called step-parents. Sometimes, divorced parents get married once again. Bad relationships with new step-parents lead to problems and frequent arguments. 

Family life is different all around the world. In Slovakia many families meet together for special days, such as birthdays, weddings, feasts and funerals. A family, a real home and relatives are what we need for life. They always help us when we need them. 


&nbsp;
## 2. Culture and Art
Culture and art are important for us because they add aesthetic value to our lives, use they add aesthetic value to our lives. Cultural events are an interesting way how people can spend their free time. Art is a way of communicating feelings. Artists express themselves in many forms music, literature, architecture, painting, drawing, sculpture. Music, dance and theatre are performing arts. Painting, sculpture, architecture and photography are decorative arts.

Cities offer many cultural attractions to citizens and tourists. People who like classical music can enjoy a chamber music concert in concert halls. Mozart, Beethoven and Bach have become the most important European composers. Fans of different music styles - pop, rock, jazz, blues or country can enjoy music at the festivals, go to see their favourite singers or bands perform live at concerts or simply
listen to CDs, MP3 players or watch concerts on DVDs. In towns, people have the possibility to go to the theatre to see various performances. The most popular are musicals. Film lovers can go to cinemas to watch dubbed or subtitled films. The multi-screen air-conditioned complexes in shopping centres are becoming more and more popular. Open- air cinemas are a popular option among the young in summer. The lovers of fine arts can go to galleries to see the artwork of famous painters and sculptors. The works of Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Michelangelo are immortal.

Cultural events in villages and rural areas are not very frequent. In Slovak villages, the so-called houses of culture are the main centres of cultural life. The most popular cultural events in villages are dance balls where people dance polka, waltz, tango or modern dances. Slovak villages are famous for promoting folklore traditions. There are folklore festivals of folklore music, dances and songs organised for example in Východná, Myjava, Detva and elsewhere. Nowadays, most young people prefer modern music and modern dance to folklore.

&nbsp;
## 3. Sports and Games
There are indoor and outdoor sports. Gymnastics is sport. It can all the year round in gyms. Athletics, cycling, hiking and most aquatic (water) sports, like sailing, regatta, water-skiing, diving, wind-surfing and others are outdoor sports practised mainly during the summer. Swimming is also a typical summer sport. In winter it is possible to practise it in indoor pools. Sportsmen practise winter sports, such as skiing, skating, snowboarding and tobogganing. Skiers can practise the giant slalom, downhill racing or ski jumps in ski resorts where there are good snow conditions. In Slovakia there are a lot of ski resorts in the High and Low Tatras. 

Games are played by at least two players. The most popular games are football, rugby, hockey, tennis, golf, cricket, basketball, volleyball, badminton, squash and handball. The British are sport-loving people. The Cup Final is the most important football match of the year in England. It is played at the Wembley Stadium near London. The Slovaks are good at hockey. A lot of Slovak hockey players play in American and Canadian National Hockey League teams. Becoming a professional hockey player is one of the most frequent dreams of Slovak boys. Tennis, another popular game, is played on courts. The most famous tennis tournament is held at Wimbledon every year. The championships are watched by thousands of people all over the world. The most popular games in America are baseball, American football, rugby, basketball, tennis, squash, boxing, wrestling and ice hockey. Squash is a game for two players played in a four-walled court with a special racket and a soft ball. 

Most people do sports because it is good for their body and mind. Some sport activities, such as aerobics, jogging, swimming or body building, are preferred by those who want to lose weight. Doing a sport is a good way of spending free time. Professional sports are often connected with overtraining or doping. During important competitions, such as the Olympic Games, sportsmen are tested and may easily be disqualified. This has a negative impact on their career. Success in professional sports is nowadays connected with money and popularity.

&nbsp;
## 4. Housing
Living in towns and cities has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there are many possibilities for jobs, education, sports and social life. There are many cultural events there, such as concerts, operas and theatre performances. People can visit cafés, pubs and night clubs. There are many shops, shopping malls and hospitals too. On the other hand, city inhabitants live in polluted, noisy, crowded and hectic places. There is often a lot of mess and dirt in the streets. Many city people live in housing estates, which is not an ideal place for children. There is also a high level of crime. 

Many Slovaks live in flats. Some of them have cottages in the mountains where they like spending their weekends. The British prefer to live in houses. There are several types of houses in Britain, for example terraced houses which are built in a row, semi-detached houses that have one common wall, detached houses that stand by themselves and bungalows. Some Slovak houses are big enough for two families - grandparents, their children and grandchildren. 

The furniture in British and Slovak rooms is not very different these days. The sitting room has a settee and armchairs, a wall unit and a hi-fi system, television and video, a bookcase and a coffee table. There is a carpet on the floor to make the room warm and comfortable. Most of the British houses have a fireplace because of cold weather. In the kitchen there are kitchen cupboards, a sink, a cooker, a fridge. There is also a table with chairs or stools. The floor in the kitchen is often tiled. Slovak families usually have their  washing machine in the bathroom, the British in the kitchen. The bedroom has a double bed, built-in wardrobes, a dressing table with a mirror and a stool in front of the table. 

In the USA an average American family lives in a large house with many rooms. In large American cities, many people live in downtown apartments (flats). Like the British, Americans do not usually stay in the same house their whole lives. Some families like to move to other parts of the country and change houses every ten years. 

&nbsp;
## 5. Shopping and Services 
Shopping is an activity people love or hate. Nowadays, people can do shopping in huge shopping centres or in small specialised shops. A shopping mall is a large indoor shopping centre with different types of shops, cinemas, wellness centres and bowling centres. They also have cafés, snack bars, restaurants where people can relax after doing shopping. They are open late in the evening and on weekends. Department stores sell their customers all kinds of foods, clothes, shoes, toys, sporting goods, cosmetics, books and furniture all under one roof. Many Slovaks do their shopping in hypermarkets, such as Carrefour or Tesco. 

There are still some small specialised shops which save your time, energy and money too. Corner shops sell different foodstuffs (tea, coffee, bottled beer, juice, sweets, vegetables, fruit) and dairy products (milk, butter, cream, cheese and yoghurt). They also sell newspapers and magazines. Various kinds of fresh bread, rolls, buns and cakes can be bought at the baker's. Butcher's sell fresh, canned or frozen meat and meat products (salami, ham, sausages). Fresh vegetables and all kinds of fruit can be bought at the greengrocer's. Many people prefer shopping at the market where there is a wide choice of potatoes, cabbage, beans, carrots, tomatoes, apples, pears, oranges or bananas. The chemist's is a specialised shop where people can buy medicines but also cosmetics. Boutiques sell different dresses, shirts, skirts, blouses, pullovers, jeans and so on. Shoes, belts and bags are sold in shoe shops. 

In everyday life, people also need different kinds of services performed by hairdressers, car-mechanics, garden designers, plumbers, lawyers, real estate agents or doctors. Almost everybody uses postal services. The post distributes letters, postcards, telegrams and parcels to the recipients. If the post cannot deliver a letter or parcel for some reason, it is sent back to the sender. We can also use postal services to send money. In the past, people sent many letters and postcards by post. Nowadays, they send e-mail letters, e-mail postcards or text messages. Banks provide financial services to the people. We can pay cash or by bank card. In Slovakia it is not usual to pay by cheque. Most people have a current account in a bank. Their earnings regularly come to their account. When they need cash, they withdraw money from the account through a cash machine, using a bank card. for If we need to borrow money, the bank can give us a loan. If the bank lends us money building a house, the money is called a mortgage. 

&nbsp;
## 6. Health Care
More and more people know that good health means a longer and happier life. Nowadays, people care about their health more than they did in the past. They eat healthier food, practise different kinds of sports and try to avoid stressful situations. A healthy, strong and beautiful body is an ideal for many people. Being in a good shape and good mental health are the basic conditions for good life. Doctors often say that headaches and stomachaches are the results of depression. Bad eating habits, lack of physical activities and stress are negative factors which cause serious diseases. 

When we are ill, we usually see a doctor (general practitioner). Sometimes, we we need to have an appointment with a specialist. The doctor examines our body, asks about the symptoms and usually prescribes some medication on a prescription. Then, we go to the pharmacy to get our antibiotics, painkillers or vitamins. When the illness is too serious, the patient is taken to the hospital to be operated. Basic health care is free in Slovakia for all people who pay their insurance monthly. 

Everybody goes through various diseases during their childhood and adult life. Most of the diseases are not serious and do not take a long time to cure. In the past, diseases, such as flu, tuberculosis or scarlet fever, killed many people. Nowadays, there exist vaccines against most of them. There are diseases which we have problems to cure or cannot cure at all yet. Cancer is one of them. More than 3.6 million people are infected with AIDS. Many countries in the world spend a lot of money on public campaigns and advertisements which warn of the dangers. Publicity advices heterosexuals to use a condom and have one sexual partner only. 

&nbsp;
## 7. Traveling
People travel to work, to school, on business or for pleasure. When people travel abroad for holidays, they often address travel agencies to arrange travel, accommodation, insurance and a travel guide. Slovaks do not need passports anymore to travel to the EU countries. They only need their identification cards. Last minute or first moment offers are very popular. 

Airports, railway stations, seaports and bus stops are always full of people travelling for long or short distances. Travelling by air is exciting, fast, comfortable, relatively safe but expensive. Passengers need their flight tickets and passports. People and their luggage is checked when they go through the customs. During the flight, passengers are offered some meals, refreshments and drinks by stewards and stewardesses. 

People commute by trains to work or school. They are cheap, less polluting and safe but not very clean and comfortable. Slow trains stop at every station. Fast trains and intercity trains are more comfortable for longer distances. They do not stop at every station. Trains on longer journeys often have a sleeping car and a dining car. 

Coaches are buses for long-distance travel. They are fast and comfortable and not very expensive. In our country many people prefer coaches to trains. During the holidays, travel coach trips to mountain or seaside resorts. When travelling by coach to London, passengers can have an interesting experience of crossing the English many agencies offer Channel by ferry. 

Cars are comfortable and quick; they are not safe, they pollute the environment and are expensive. It is interesting that the number of cars, drivers and highways is higher every year. In Slovakia the age limit for a driving licence is eighteen. Careful driving, respecting speed limits and strict alcohol tests reduce traffic accidents. 

Many people like travelling by bike. Some go to school by bike; others prefer cycling as a sport ora hobby. Many people go on a cycling holiday. Cycling is healthy and exciting. 

&nbsp; 
## 8. Education 
Good education is very important for a successful life. In Slovakia school attendance is compulsory from the age of 6 to 16. After nursery schools and kindergartens, children start to attend an elementary school at the age of 6. When they are 16, they can decide to leave the school with an elementary qualification or to continue to a secondary school. Pupils usually have to pass entrance exams to continue their studies at secondary schools. The best students apply to study at a grammar school (or high school) called gymnázium, which prepares for university study. There are ary different types of secondary schools which usually take 4 years; the most popular are secondary business schools, technical schools and medical schools. Vocational schools and their training centres prepare students for different kinds of professions. The study lasts either 3 years and it ends with achieving a skill certificate or 5 years which ends with a school-leaving exam called maturita. Some subjects are compulsory, others are elective. Students at vocational schools must take a theoretical and practical exam from their specialised subjects too. After finishing study at secondary schools, students can get a job or apply to study at university. In most cases, they have to take an entrance exam to get in. A study at university takes 5 or 6 years and finishes with graduation where graduates are given diplomas to their majors. 

Students schedule and school subjects differ from school to school. Vocational school students must also take some practical lessons outside their schools, called the practice. A school year in Slovakia starts the first week of September and finishes the last week of June. Unit 8: EDUCATION 55 In between, there are a few days off (for example the All Saint's Day, Easter or the May days). There are winter holidays, which last about two weeks and spring holidays, which last one week. The summer holidays are the longest and last two months. 

Extracurricular activities are very popular in the afternoons. There are many different clubs and sports teams at schools which meet after the classes. Many schools publish their own student newspapers and some have their own radio stations. Most schools in Slovakia have their own gym, school canteen and sometimes a swimming pool, school playground and language schools. 

&nbsp;
## 9. Jobs
Employment is contract between an employer and an employee. The employer is a person (or an institution) who hires employees. People who have their own business are self-employed. The unemployed are people who lost their job, quit or were fired. They live on the dole and are on a list in job centres, which help them find a new job. 

When people search for a new job, they look at several factors, such as type of work, possible promotion and career development, salary, working time, travel opportunities, place of work and others. The available positions are published in the newspapers or on the Internet. The candidates send the job application and their CV (curriculum vitae) together with a letter of motivation. Their CV should include personal data and details about education, skills and work experience. The best candidates are invited to an oral interview. At the interview, they usually answer questions, describe their motivations and expectations. Candidates should prepare well for the interview, find information about the organisation or the company, answer clearly and stay calm. Successful candidates are offered a job with a starting salary, position, medical benefits and vacation days. 

People have full-time jobs and part-time jobs. Doctors, nurses, truck drivers work in shifts. Manual workers work in manufacturing or construct buildings. Teachers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, artists work intellectually. Nowadays, more and more professions require communication and organisation skills. Professions like a policeman, pilot, construction worker are very dangerous professions because there is a high risk of an injury or an accident. 

The labour market in Slovakia changed in the last ten years. Many work opportunities were created thanks to foreign investors who came to our country to set up their companies here. Young people with good reference and experience are preferred to fresh graduates and older people. 

&nbsp;
## 10. People and Nature
Slovakia has a continental climate with four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. The weather in spring and autumn is alike: light showers, cloudy days and sunny intervals are typical. Winters are normally cold and snowy. Summers are hot, with many sunny days and a few summer storms. 

The climate of a region determines what plants grow and what animals live in that region. Plants are an important part in the cycle of nature. There would be no life on Earth without them. Animals depend directly or indirectly on plants because they cannot make their own food. Plants also produce the oxygen we breathe. According to the scientists, there are about 260 000 species of plants and about 9 or 10 million species of animals. Nowadays, the existence of some plants and animals is in danger. For example elephants, tigers, pandas, whales, great apes, marine turtles, polar bears, rhinos, snow leopards and dolphins are at the top of the Red List of Threatened Species. In Slovakia bisons, wolves, foxes, eagles are also in danger. 

The most serious ecological problems of today are the pollution of air, water and soil, destruction of ecosystems, disappearance of many species of animal and plants, changes in weather, acid rain, global warming, destruction of tropical rain forests and destruction of the ozone layer. Most of this damage, which proceeds faster and faster, has not been caused by natural catastrophes but by man himself. Technical progress, which enables us to live a more comfortable life, leads to the degradation of quality of environment we live in. 

Professional organisations, environmentalists, ecologists, biologists, volunteers or just nature lovers do their best to protect nature and save life on Earth. We all can contribute to this by respecting the laws of nature. In forests, it is not allowed to make noise, set fire, cut wood, drop litter, poison air and lakes with chemicals and so on. People can be fined or even imprisoned for breaking the laws. 

&nbsp;
## 11. Science and Technology
Technology is a product of science. Society depends on technology and technology exists thanks to the needs of society. New technological inventions make people's life easier. The industrial revolution, which started in the 18th century in England, brought many technological changes and inventions. Since then, technology has become part of our everyday life. 

People made big scientific and technological progress in transport, medicine, biology and information technology. The progress in the car industry and aviation is also incredible. We can see it when we compare how people travelled in the past and how they travel today. 

Great progress has been made in medicine. Science and technology helps ease the pain of some diseases, it cures them and prevents some of them too. Nowadays, doctors can help in surgeries that are taking place in another part of the country. On the video phone, a doctor can see the patient and speak directly to the doctors performing the operation. 

During the last ten years, there was a great change in information and communication technologies, especially in wireless technology. Nowadays, computers are used almost everywhere. The inventions of a cell phone and the Internet help people communicate faster. Mobile phones are a symbol of comfortable and quick communication or fashion, mainly among the young. A cell phone, music player, camera and a palm computer are being put together into one little gadget. 

The Internet saves our time and money to find information. Many professions or services depend on the Internet. Via the Internet, we send documents, buy things, book hotels, reserve tickets, transfer our money or find life partners. These days, more and more Unit 11: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 73 people use e-mail to communicate and send information or documents. Many Slovaks use the Internet as a type of entertainment. They can easily find articles about what they are interested in, download music or films. Chatting, joining different discussion groups and reading blogs is very popular, especially among the young. 

Modern technology helps us daily. However, it can also be misused. For example, on the one hand, we drive cars daily and on the other hand, they pollute the air. 

&nbsp;
## 12. People and Society
Etiquette describes formal rules and traditions of behaviour in a certain society and culture. Modern etiquette teaches us to greet people with respect, offer hospitality to guests, wear clothing appropriate for certain occasions, join the conversations without dominating them. It also describes how to behave in specific situations. It teaches us to offer a chair, help those who need it, eat neatly and quietly, not to play loud music or make noise and arrive in time when visiting somebody. 

Different social rules are followed at home, at work and in business. The social rules of hosting guests, dining, clothing, etc. are specific for different cultures. What is appropriate in one culture (for example in a European country) can be totally unacceptable in another culture (for example in a Muslim country). Some rules are the same all around the world. It is important to be polite and to use the magic words: "Thank you", "Please", "Sorry". When somebody invites us for a visit, we should come in time. We should bring a small present to the host, for example flowers, chocolate or a bottle of wine. It is not polite to visit somebody without arranging it in advance. The food etiquette includes some rules. For example, it is impolite to ask for more food. It is fine to have more food when it is offered by the hosts. The tea should be poured from a teapot after a minute or two it has been made. Soup should be eaten quietly. Hands should never be used for eating. 

Children learn the social rules from their parents, teachers and friends. It is important to teach them what behaviour is correct and wrong. Family is the place where social behaviour is formed. If parents speak rudely, children will imitate their "models". If parents have only TV dinners, children will not know how to behave at the table. Small things such as talking to people with respect, listening to them and showing empathy should be normal in every family. 

&nbsp;
## 13. The Young and Their World
People from the age of thirteen to the age of nine because their age in "teen" in English. During puberty, most children go through dramatic physical changes. Teenagers also undergo mental developments. Their emotional life is more intensive than before. Love and friendship become the most important values. Teenagers prefer relationships with their peers to their parents. 

Young people often feel unstable and look for security. They search for a unique identity. Sports play. ers, rock stars, film actors, reality show stars often become their role models. Teenagers care a lot about what they look like. They follow the fashion trends closely and they always want to be "in". They have similar interests such as music, dance, film or fashion. They identify themselves with others, but at the same time they want to be different and develop their own individuality. 

This age of revolt often leads to conflicts between the generations, called a generation gap. Young people think that their parents care too much and are overprotective. Children often have different ideas about their future, different life expectations and opinions on drug use or politics than their parents do. All this creates tension between parents and children. They also differ in clothing and hairstyles. Most teenagers would like to start their own independent lives but are still financially dependent on their parents. In this age, young people are under pressure. They have to decide about their future career. 

Unemployment is a big problem in our society. Financial worries, frustration, unstable emotions and lack of emotional intelligence among some adolescents may also lead to youth crime, such as vandalism and violence. Groups of youngsters with racial prejudice often provoke conflicts in many countries. Alcoholism, drug use and gambling are the results of frustration, family conflicts or other teenage problems. 

&nbsp;
## 14. Food
Normally, we eat three times a day - we have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Eating habits on the lifestyle of people. Busy managers do not eat regularly, young people often choose fast food, women who want to lose weight eat as little as possible and kids are often fussy about their food. 

Slovaks usually have bread with butter, jam, honey, ham or cheese for breakfast; some prefer scrambled eggs or sausage. The English usually begin the day with a cup of tea or coffee. The traditional English breakfast starts with cereals - porridge or cornflakes. This is sometimes followed by fried bacon and eggs or sausages with fried tomatoes, often on the weekends. 

In our country lunch is the main meal consisting of soup, a main course with a side dish and a dessert. Slovaks like to eat meat, usually pork, beef or poultry with potatoes or rice. Bryndzové halušky (gnocchi with sheep cheese) is considered a Slovak national meal. Hungarian cuisine, typical for spicy meals, is quite popular in the southern parts of Slovakia. Italian cuisine, mostly pizza and pasta, has become very popular in our country and it is preferred to traditional Slovak meals in many restaurants. Some Slovaks like going to Chinese or Mexican restaurants. Schoolchildren have lunch in canteens. Businessmen eat in restaurants where a daily menu at reduced prices is offered during lunchtime. In Britain lunch is a light meal consisting of a warm dish (rarely soup) and a dessert, or just sandwiches, some fruit, pudding or ice cream. Beef, chicken or lamb is served with potatoes, vegetables and gravy. Many Americans like to have lunch and dinner "out" - at snack bars, fast food restaurants or expensive hotels. They also use take-away services. 

Dinner, the main meal in Britain and America, is served in the evening at between 6 and 7 o'clock when all the members of the family are at home. This meal is often eaten in front of the television. Most dinners during the week are simple, often using pre-cooked food with frozen vegetables, which can be heated quickly. Many supermarkets sell frozen "TV dinners", which can be quickly prepared in the oven or a microwave. Typical take-away food includes pizza, Chinese food and the traditional fish and chips. The Slovaks prepare dinner themselves at home. It is either a warm meal or a sandwich. Sometimes they order pizza. Some people have a light supper, often cheese and biscuits and a glass of milk or a mug of cocoa before going to bed. 

&nbsp;
## 15. Hobbies, Leisure and Lifestyle
Free time after work or study is for fun, entertainment, going out or doing hobbies. Hobbies are connected to lifestyles. Some people like to be on their own and learn new things by reading books. Others enjoy company and often go out or do collective sports. Our hobbies should fit our character and complement well our work or study. 

Teenagers have their own special leisure interests. These include playing team sports, dancing at a favourite disco, going to parties or joining some clubs. They like to spend their leisure time actively in groups, in good company. Those who prefer staying at home usually watch DVDs, listen to music, browse the Internet or chat on the Internet. Typical teenage sports are roller-skating and skateboarding. 

Many children and young people join different clubs where they practise their hobbies. The most popular are football, tennis, dance or horse riding clubs. Sometimes, it is not their choice but the choice of their parents. Some parents force their children to play an instrument or do some sport because they think they will prevent them from taking drugs or drinking alcohol. 

Many people have creative hobbies, such as acting, choir singing, folk dancing and playing pop-music in amateur groups. Photography, painting and drawing are also popular hobbies. There are many opportunities for people to develop their talents in these areas. 

A lot of people, both children and adults, keep a pet. Older people like gardening, doing practical jobs around their houses (DIY - do it yourself), fishing, reading, going to theatre, concerts or art exhibitions. Slovak pensioners are quite traditional and prefer staying at home. 

At present, more and more people of all ages spend their leisure time doing exercises to keep fit. Hiking, cycling, rowing, playing golf and tennis are enjoyed by people all over the world. It is quite common to see parties of hikers, cyclists or rowers spending their weekends outdoors. Those who prefer indoor physical exercises, such as body building or aerobics, go to fitness centres. A relatively recent sport enjoyed by the young is snow-boarding, which combines skiing, surfing and skateboarding. Many Slovaks travel abroad to practise less common sports, such as scuba diving, yachting and playing golf. 

&nbsp;
## 16. Multicultural Society
A multicultural society is a country where different cultural groups live together. They try to preserve their cultures, habits and traditions. Cultural differences should be respected and tolerated. This is the official policy in Canada, Australia and the UK. Immigrants can have dual citizenship, they can use their minority language and they can keep their culture and religion. In some countries they are expected to mix and integrate into the national culture. A typical example is the USA where immigrants preserve their own culture but also become Americans. Cultural adaptation is more difficult when immigrants have to adapt to different cultural values or religion. Lack of cultural integration can cause the isolation of immigrant minorities. This can provoke reactions of xenophobia and racism, which can lead to serious incidents. 

In 2004, Slovakia became part of a larger community - the European Community. Many Slovaks decided to leave the country for study or work; a lot of them got married abroad and created bicultural families. Living in a bicultural (or cross-cultural) family requires a lot of tolerance and understanding from both sides. Practising the traditions and habits of two cultures can be a good compromise and benefit for the couple and their children. Nowadays, there are many study programmes which make student exchange possible. Students go to live and study in a culturally different country in a "host family". Such exchanges are usually very beneficial. People learn about new cultures, make friends and become tolerant. 

Slovakia is also a multicultural country. The majority of Slovak population is Slovak. The country also has several minorities, the biggest of which are Hungarian, Roma, Ruthenian and Ukrainian. The Roma population in Slovakia has problems to adapt and is often a victim of racist attacks.
